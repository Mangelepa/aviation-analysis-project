 aviation accident analysis for fleet procurement
 ## Overview
Analysis of Naviation accident data (1962-2023) to identify safest aircraft for commercial fleet procurement.

## Business Understanding
 **Key Business Questions**:
1. Which aircraft models have the lowest accident rates?
2. What flight phases are most prone to accidents?
3. How has aviation safety improved over time?

## Data Understanding and Analysis
**Data Source**: [National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)](https://data.ntsb.gov/avdata)

**Dataset Characteristics**:
- Time period: 1962-2023
- 142,309 accident records
- Key fields: Aircraft make/model, flight phase, injuries, fatalities

**Key Visualizations**:
1. [Safety Trends]  
   *Accident trends showing 22% reduction since 2010*
2. [Risk Heatmap] 
   *Manufacturer vs flight phase risk analysis*
3. ![Top Models]  
   *Top 10 safest aircraft models by fatality rate*

## Conclusion
**Key Findings**:
1. Cessna 172 has the lowest fatality rate (8%) among high-usage models but still prone to accidents
2. most of cesnar accidents occur during unknown phases phase
3. Airbus shows 15% annual improvement in safety metrics
4. helicopters tend be less prone to accidents
**Recommendations**:
1. Prioritize Cessna 172 for short-haul routes
2. start with helicopters for experimental purpose 
3. Consider Airbus A220 for medium-haul routes
